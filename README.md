# 10.9-Mac-Admin-Bash-Shell-Scripts
This is just a series of Bash Shell Scripts that I've created for Mac Administration purposes.

Most of them are based off of security standards that most organizations require for Mac's to run in their environment.

Its nothing big right now but I hope to add to it soon with some more complex scripts later on and possibly a homemade tool 
that will allow you to administer the scripts.
